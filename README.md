# About
This was a little project I put together while learning React. More of a demonstration of my abilities than a functional application. It interfaces with the awesome [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org) to pull back movie information and images. Coming from a background in Rails and AngularJS the transition to React for this project was a fun challenge. I look forward to using React in my future projects!

## Code Samples
In this project I wanted to focus on writing clean and modern es6 code with React 16. Heres a few samples I wanted to show off. Feel free to check all the source files out in the repo!

### Modern ES6

I tried to use es6 syntax as much as I could in this project. Here I'm using the async/await keyword from es6 2017. (Don't steal my api key please :D)

### Styled Components

Styled components are awesome! They keep all the styling logic contained in the your components. This also allows you to rename common html elements so that your  jsx code is descriptive and easy to read. While I can understand the sentiment of not wanting to write your css in a js file, in my opinion styled components are very elegant and compliment React's syntax well.

### Pure, and Functional Stateless Components

PureComponents and functional stateless components are core to react. While working on this project I learned when and where to use the different component types and the performance boosts you get with each.

### More!
I learned about many other great tools in this project such as React Overdrive for animations and React router for, well routing. Everything is in the repo if you want to explore more!
